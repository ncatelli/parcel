## General
A toy parser combinator library for rust.

## Warnings
Please nobody use this. This is entirely an experiment to support insane restrictions I've imposed on myself to build a computer from first principles.

Instead, please use the wonderful [geal/nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) project that is better supported, better engineered and WAY more mature... frankly I don't even know why you are even looking at this.
